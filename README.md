# WebScraper
I created a web scraper that can be used to scrape data from the Shelby County Criminal Justice System (CJS). To view 
the code for the web scraper, see the scrappy.py file in this repo.

Data was collected and analyzed for the Just City take home assessment and the full analysis notebook can be viewed 
here:
